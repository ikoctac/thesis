In the requirements.txt file there is all the packages needed for the project to work.

In my case i created a venv, then activated it and installed the packages from the requirments.txt directly
(pip install -r requirements.txt).

You will also need to change the paths to .env.example and change its name to .env to specify the paths.

*If you want to operate the code you will need to download(https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hTr162-ppmlGBXUenu24Q-DO3Q02ycLG?usp=sharing) the trained models or train your models and run the program. Alternatively you can modify the code to run without the text-simplification addition.*

Execute by running the main.py
